# Linux-clone
This is a python project that clones some of the commands from a linux system. By running the nautilus.py file, you can create virtual directories, files, 
change permissions, change  users, and much more by using commands like mkdir, touch, chmod etc that you would normally use on a linux system. These 
files and directories are never actually created however.
